Instructions to Use the Setup Files
Unix-like Systems: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing setup.sh, and run:

bash
Copy code
./setup.sh
This script will create the environment, install dependencies, and check for FFmpeg.

Windows: Open Command Prompt as Administrator, navigate to the directory containing setup.bat, and run:

batch
Copy code
setup.bat
This script performs the same actions as the Unix script but is tailored for the Windows environment.
