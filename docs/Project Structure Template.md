Project Structure Template
1. Directory Structure
Organize your project into a clear directory structure that separates each component of your application:
•	/your_project
    /src
        /api           # RESTful API interfaces
        /core          # Business logic
        /models        # Data models and database schema
        /services      # Business processes and services
        /utils         # Utility scripts and helper functions
    /tests             # Unit and integration tests
    /gui              # GUI components, separated by framework if multiple GUIs are used
    /config           # Configuration files and environment variables
    /scripts          # Deployment scripts and other automation scripts
    /docs             # Documentation files

2. Core Components
Core Business Logic (src/core): This should include the main functionality of your application, such as file processing, transcription management, and any machine learning models you use. Keep this separate from any GUI code.
Data Models (src/models): Define your data structures and database interactions here. This could be ORM models if you’re using something like SQLAlchemy in Python.
Services (src/services): Implement the logic for external interactions and complex processes, like AWS S3 integration, sentiment analysis, etc.

3. API Layer (src/api)
Develop a RESTful API that can be consumed by your GUI and potentially by other clients when you move to a SaaS model. Flask or Django are good choices for this if you're in the Python ecosystem.

4. GUI (gui/)
Start with a simple implementation using a framework suitable for prototypes, such as Tkinter or Flask for web templates.
Keep GUI code completely separate from the business logic. Only interact with the core through API calls or service layer invocations.

5. Config Management (config/)
Store configuration settings outside of your application code, such as in environment variables or configuration files. This includes API keys, database connection settings, and operational parameters.

6. Testing (tests/)
Develop comprehensive tests for your API, business logic, and any other backend services. Use frameworks like pytest for Python.

7. Documentation (docs/)
Maintain clear documentation for your API, setup instructions, and user guides. This is crucial when transitioning to a SaaS model where customers will integrate with your platform.

8. Deployment and Scaling
Prepare for deployment and scaling from the start. Docker can be used to containerize your application, making it easier to deploy across different environments.
Consider Kubernetes or similar orchestration tools for managing your application at scale when you transition to SaaS.
Considerations for Future Expansion
Machine Learning: Integrate machine learning models as services within your architecture. This allows you to swap out or upgrade models without affecting other parts of the application.
Multitenancy: Essential for SaaS applications. Design your application to handle multiple users and organizations simultaneously without interference.
